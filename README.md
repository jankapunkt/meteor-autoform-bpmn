### Install

In order to install this package, you also need to install some npm packages:

- simpl-schema (WHich you need to use with autoForm anyway)
- bpmn-js (The bpmn-io modeler's core package)
- diagram-js (mainly required to import fonts and styles for the modeler)
- matches-selector (the bpmn modeler throws an error if this is not installed)

**Summary:**

```bash
meteor add jkuester:autoform-bpmn
meteor npm install --save simpl-schema bpmn-js diagram-js matches-selector
```
